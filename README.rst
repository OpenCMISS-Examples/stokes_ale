=============
Stokes ALE
=============

Stokes equation is a linearised form of the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of small Reynolds number.
This equation, also named creeping flow, is a type of fluid flow where advective inertial forces are small compared with viscous forces.
The ALE form of the Stokes equation is implemented in this example.


Building the example
====================

The fortran version of the example can be configured and built with CMake::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/stokes_ale.git
  mkdir stokes_ale-build
  cd stokes_ale-build
  cmake -DOpenCMISSLibs_DIR=~/opencmiss/install/  ../stokes_ale/
  make


Running the example
===================

Fortran version::

  cd ./src/fortran/
  ./stokes_ale

Python version::

  source  <path-to-opencmiss>/install/.../.../virtualenvironments/oclibs_pyXY_release/bin/activate
  cd ./src/python/
  python stokes_ale.py

where the XY in the path are the Python major and minor versions respectively.

The results can be visualised by running `visualiseStokesALE.cmgui <./src/fortran/visualiseStokesALE.cmgui>`_ with the `Cmgui visualiser <http://physiomeproject.org/software/opencmiss/cmgui/download>`_.
